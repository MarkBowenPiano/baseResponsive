baseResponsive
==============

A simple responsive version of 'Base'

baseResponsive builds upon 'Base' and includes a simple set of media queries and minimal css to layout the theme. These declarations are not meant to be stuck to. If you want to rework them as you develop your WordPress theme that's cool. I've included a copy of bits of structural html so you can see how the basic layout will work out of the box and again as the developer you can change these or rename your classes. 

Each template includes just the basic WordPress functionality and hooks to start a new WordPress website with. Page templates, post templates, multi blog layouts, categories and archives, plus a custom post type layout is include. Everything you need to get started building a WordPress website.

Like Base, baseResponsive includes,

- Eric Meyer's CSS reset
- HTML5 pollyfills for ie9 and below
- Targetted classes for ie 7 and up
- jQuery version 1.10.2
- jQuery UI version 1.10.0
- WordPress' body_class(); tag
- WP Nav functionality so user can edit their site menu's easily via the dashboard
- Simple WP loops for displaying pages and posts. 
- Included Breadcrumbs functions
- Search, Category, Blog and Archive Templates.
- A blank Home Template to create unique homepage layouts with.
- A simple 404 template.
- A custom post type template with an easily customizable query loop.
